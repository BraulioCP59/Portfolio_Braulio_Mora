## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. My goal is to build an effective portfolio that will highlight my strongest applications and showcase my though process behind the implementation of each use case. I believe that students who have a portfolio with stable applications that are live and deployed are successful in finding employment soon after they graduate.
